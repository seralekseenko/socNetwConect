# Tasks.

##  1.  Social network connectivity.

Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m
timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an
 algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are
 connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a
  friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by
  timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The
  running time of your algorithm should be "m log‚Å° n" or better and
  use extra space proportional to n.

## 2. Union-find with specific canonical element.

Add a method find() to the union-find data type so that find(i) returns
the largest element in the connected component containing i.
The operations, union(), connected(), and find() should all take
logarithmic time or better.

For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9}, then the
find() method should return 9 for each of the four elements in the
connected components.
